name: recon-fingerprint-triage
description: Triage recon fingerprint candidates across the bounded DNS catalog surface. Reads private single-domain discovery output, aggregate catalog baselines, or candidate queues, then classifies candidates as pending, promoted, rejected, or deferred under the v2.14 catalog-quality gates. Use when the user asks to find missing fingerprints, review unclassified DNS observations, or improve catalog coverage.
license: Apache-2.0
compatibility: Requires recon-tool 2.18.4 or a compatible v2 release and Python 3.11+. Use connected MCP tools or a shell with recon on PATH. Live lookups require public network access. Catalog patching and tests require a separate recon source checkout.

# recon-fingerprint-triage

This skill reviews the bounded public DNS observations that recon already
collects and helps maintainers improve the fingerprint catalog. It supports the
multi-record v2.14 quality loop rather than treating catalog growth as a count
of new CNAME suffixes.

This is the portable Agent Skills form used by the schema-pinned
candidate. It omits client-only frontmatter and does not depend on experimental
`allowed-tools` behavior. Package compatibility remains unclaimed until the
frozen representative-client evaluation is complete.

## When to use this

Use this skill when the user wants to:

- review unmatched DNS observations by record type;
- triage a private catalog baseline or recurrence queue;
- assess a proposed fingerprint rule;
- strengthen an existing slug with an independent evidence path;
- prepare a catalog patch and its required fixtures.

For an ordinary domain lookup, use the base `recon` skill. This skill is for
catalog maintenance, not general domain intelligence.

## Environment and source checkout

An installed recon runtime or connected recon MCP server is enough to review
user-supplied observations and inspect the current catalog. Use the tool names
actually exposed by the client; no fixed MCP namespace or shell is required
when those tools are already connected. For catalog absence, read the complete
`recon://fingerprints` resource or page `get_fingerprints(limit=20, offset=0)`
until a page contains fewer than 20 entries. These catalog reads are local.

Catalog patching, formatter changes, validation scripts, and repository tests
require a separate recon source checkout selected by the user. Before using
them, identify that checkout root and read its `AGENTS.md` and project guidance.
Paths under `docs/`, `src/`, `scripts/`, `validation/`, and `tests/` below refer
to that checkout, not the installed skill directory or an arbitrary working
directory. Documentation links may be read when browsing is available; they
do not provide executable scripts or a writable checkout.

Without the checkout or required evidence, return the review and gate ledger
with affected candidates still `pending`. Do not fabricate successful tests,
edit the installed package, or clone a repository without a separate request.

## Inputs

Choose the narrowest input the user supplied. Treat every real-domain input and
every per-domain row as private working data.

### A. Single-domain discovery

Only collect when the user requested collection. Full typed unclassified
discovery requires the CLI; `lookup_tenant` has no `include_unclassified`
parameter. Without a shell, review a supplied private discovery artifact.
For explicitly requested CNAME-only discovery, a connected
`discover_fingerprint_candidates(domain)` is an alternative, but returns
suffix/count/sample candidates, not the three collections below. It can run an
ordinary public-metadata lookup on a cache miss, so it is not a local catalog
check. Do not treat that limited result as full typed discovery.

For the CLI, follow the base `recon` skill's domain-validation workflow.
When that skill is unavailable, lowercase the input and strip a leading
`https://`, `http://`, or `www.`, then require the entire remaining value to
match `^[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9.-]{0,251}[a-z0-9])?$`. Reject malformed input rather
than removing other characters. Pass only the validated value as a quoted
argument:

```text
recon "<validated-domain>" --json --include-unclassified
```

Read all three catalog-discovery collections when present:

- `dns_catalog_summary` for bounded opportunity and classification counts;
- `unclassified_dns_observations` for typed unmatched values;
- `unclassified_cname_chains` for the historical related-host CNAME view.

The payload is a private review aid. Do not copy its queried domain, owner
names, opaque tokens, target-owned record values, tenant identifiers, or
per-domain rows into a committed memo, fixture, issue, pull request, or other
public artifact.

### B. Multi-record catalog round

Use the private outputs produced by `validation/catalog_baseline.py` and the
round protocol in [`docs/catalog-strategy.md`](https://github.com/blisspixel/recon/blob/v2.18.4/docs/catalog-strategy.md). Keep these dimensions separate:

- `cname_target` related-host chains;
- apex `cname`;
- non-SPF `txt`;
- `spf` include and redirect targets;
- `mx` and `ns` hosts;
- `caa` issuer values;
- `dmarc_rua` destinations;
- bounded owner-qualified `subdomain_txt`;
- bounded `srv` observations.

Do not pool unlike record types into one coverage rate. Preserve the round's
catalog digest, collection options, source-opportunity counts, unresolved and
unavailable counts, truncation state, stratum, and frozen regression budget.
For a new corpus or round, start with the repository maintainer workflow in
`docs/catalog-maintenance.md`. Triage does not authorize new collection, and an
evaluation holdout is not a candidate-development queue.

### C. Historical CNAME candidate queue

`gaps.json` or `candidates.json` from `validation/find_gaps.py` and
`validation/triage_candidates.py` remains accepted for the historical
`cname_target` path. Its recurrence counts are a prioritization signal, not
proof that a pattern is correct or promotable.

## Dispositions

Every new candidate begins as `pending`. Assign one of these dispositions and
record the reason:

1. `pending`: plausible, but one or more promotion gates remain open.
2. `promoted`: all promotion gates passed and the patch plus tests are ready.
3. `rejected`: the candidate is over-broad, target-specific, unsupported,
   misleading, or fails an independent negative or regression budget.
4. `deferred`: the candidate may be useful later, but the record is too rare,
   the owner space is not enumerable, or no current independent basis exists.

Never describe a candidate as promoted merely because a YAML stanza was
drafted or a pattern matched the development data.

## Mandatory promotion gates

A candidate remains `pending` until every item below is satisfied:

1. **Exact rule shape.** Name the exact supported record type and the narrowest
   reusable pattern. State whether matching is exact, prefix, suffix, or the
   type-specific grammar documented in [`docs/fingerprints.md`](https://github.com/blisspixel/recon/blob/v2.18.4/docs/fingerprints.md).
2. **Independent basis.** Cite a current provider-owned public reference or a
   disclosure-safe aggregate basis that did not consume the same row as both
   predictor and label. Repetition alone is not an independent label.
3. **recon rule review date.** Set `verified: YYYY-MM-DD` to the date the
   fingerprint pattern was last checked against that basis. This scalar is
   recon catalog metadata. It is not an Open Knowledge Format `verified` event
   and does not assert that a target uses the product.
4. **Positive fixture.** Add a reserved synthetic positive that proves the
   intended rule fires and preserves its hedged claim boundary.
5. **Lookalike-negative fixture.** Add a near miss that proves the rule does not
   broaden into an adjacent vendor, shared parent zone, customer hostname, or
   unrelated value.
6. **Sparse-result fixture.** Prove the rule does not turn a thin or degraded
   observation into a stronger product-use, ownership, or maturity claim.
7. **Provenance assertions.** Prove the emitted service or insight retains the
   exact rule, evidence type, observed value scope, and source opportunity
   required by the claim audit.
8. **Frozen regression budget.** Run the candidate against the predeclared
   round budget. Report the aggregate before-and-after result. Reject or leave
   pending any rule that exceeds it. Do not tune the pattern or budget on an
   independent holdout after reading its result.

`validation/evaluate_catalog_promotions.py` is a bounded fixed-observation
coverage diagnostic for built-in, `match_mode: any` DNS-suffix candidates in
`cname_target`, `mx`, `ns`, and `spf`. It is not full detector replay or a
precision test. Its additive coverage arithmetic cannot certify absence of
false attribution or displacement, and `accepted` does not satisfy the other
promotion gates. Unsupported types and conjunctions require dedicated detector
tests and separately justified evaluation, not a forced conversion to `any`.

If the public reference documents only a setup flow and not the proposed token
or hostname, say so. A vendor name or generic documentation homepage does not
silently become exact support for an opaque pattern.

## Record-specific review

- For `cname_target` and `cname`, prefer the stable provider-controlled product
  zone. Reject customer-specific hosts and broad shared-cloud roots.
- For `txt` and `subdomain_txt`, retain only a documented reusable prefix or
  exact non-secret marker. Never publish an opaque verification token.
- For `spf`, distinguish includes and redirects and preserve the observed
  delegation semantics.
- For `mx` and `ns`, describe routing or delegation. Do not upgrade it to
  product activity or organizational ownership.
- For `caa`, describe issuer authorization. Do not claim certificate issuance
  or deployment.
- For `dmarc_rua`, describe the published aggregate-report destination. Shared
  reporting, delegated administration, and stale configuration remain
  compatible explanations.
- For `srv`, preserve owner, service, and target semantics. A port or priority
  value does not establish reachability.

Same-zone and brand-similar targets are noise-filter candidates, not ownership
facts. An unfamiliar hostname stays pending or deferred until an independent
provider basis identifies a reusable pattern.

## YAML proposal shape

Use the existing canonical name when extending a slug. Follow the exact
type-specific grammar in [`docs/fingerprints.md`](https://github.com/blisspixel/recon/blob/v2.18.4/docs/fingerprints.md). A typical proposal is:

```yaml
- name: <canonical display name>
  slug: <lowercase-kebab>
  category: <catalog category>
  confidence: <low | medium | high>
  detections:
  - type: <exact supported record type>
    pattern: <minimal reusable pattern>
    reference: <current provider-owned URL when available>
    verified: <YYYY-MM-DD>
    description: <narrow observable meaning and compatible alternatives>
```

`tier` is valid only where the current fingerprint grammar permits it. If the
basis is a disclosure-safe aggregate rather than a provider URL, name the dated
aggregate memo in the review evidence instead of inventing a reference URL.

Before proposing a new slug, inspect the existing catalog and
`src/recon_tool/formatter/classify_tables.py:CATEGORY_BY_SLUG`. Reuse the exact
canonical name for an existing slug. Add a formatter category mapping only when
the existing classification path requires one.

## Output format

Return these sections:

1. **Disposition summary.** One row per candidate with record type,
   pending/promoted/rejected/deferred state, and a short reason.
2. **Gate ledger.** Show pass, fail, or missing for exact shape, independent
   basis, recon `verified` date, three fixture classes, provenance, and frozen
   regression budget.
3. **Proposed patch.** Include YAML and category changes only for candidates
   whose evidence is sufficient to review. Label the patch `pending` until all
   gates and tests pass.
4. **Fixture and test plan.** Name the reserved synthetic positive,
   lookalike-negative, sparse-result, provenance, and regression checks.
5. **Private follow-up.** List missing evidence without reproducing real target
   values.

For a public or committed artifact, include only generic provider patterns,
provider-owned references, reserved synthetic fixtures, and disclosure-safe
aggregate counts. Never include evaluated apexes, organization names, tenant
identifiers, opaque tokens, target-owned owner names or record values,
per-domain rows, or unsuppressed small strata.

## Verification

Use reserved synthetic fixtures for review. Run the relevant focused catalog
tests, then the freshness and generated-artifact gates. Typical focused tests
include:

```text
pytest tests/test_fingerprints.py tests/test_catalog_discovery.py \
  tests/test_dns_catalog_boundaries.py tests/test_fingerprint_freshness_gate.py
```

Also run the project-prescribed lint, full test, coverage, generated-artifact,
and CI-equivalent gates before calling the change complete. A live lookup of a
real target may be useful in the maintainer's private workspace, but it is not a
public regression fixture or permission to publish the value.

## Hard boundaries

- Do not perform direct probing beyond recon's documented collection boundary.
- Do not promote a pattern from a vendor name, hostname intuition, or recurrence
  count alone.
- Do not use a development row as its own independent precision label.
- Do not infer active use, ownership, control, plan tier, traffic, or security
  maturity from a fingerprint.
- Do not expose real-target data in public review artifacts.
- Do not map recon rule `verified`, fingerprint `confidence`, or private
  occurrence counts to OKF `verified`, trust tiers, or `usage_count`.
- Do not turn offline schema validation into an unqualified Agent Plugins
  compatibility or conformance claim.
