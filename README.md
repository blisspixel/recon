Point recon at a domain to see its **public technology and identity
footprint**: email providers and controls, identity indicators, SaaS services,
and cloud infrastructure. No credentials, API keys, or active scanning.
Use the CLI for a quick lookup, versioned JSON for automation, or the local
MCP server from an agent.

recon reports evidence-backed observations, not a complete inventory or a
security verdict. A domain does not establish an organization's boundaries.

![Synthetic recon output in a modern Linux terminal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blisspixel/recon/main/docs/assets/terminal-demo.svg)

**Synthetic illustration, generated, not captured.** The real formatter renders
a deterministic, no-network fixture for Example Industries Ltd. No real
organization is depicted, and no live lookup of reserved `example.com`
reproduces this fixture.

## Quick Start

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blisspixel/recon/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blisspixel/recon/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex"
```

The installer sets up recon for your user account, including Python when needed.
Open a new terminal afterward. Already have Python 3.11 through 3.14? Use
`pip install recon-tool` in a virtual environment, or `uv tool install recon-tool` /
`pipx install recon-tool` on managed distributions like Arch Linux and Omarchy.
For review-before-run instructions, other package managers, updates, and recovery,
see the [installation guide](https://github.com/blisspixel/recon/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md#install-or-update).

```bash
recon --version      # offline install check
recon doctor         # online connectivity and installation diagnostics
```

Lookups make DNS queries visible to recursive and authoritative infrastructure.
MTA-STS is the only default target-owned HTTP request; Google CSE and BIMI
certificate probes require explicit `--direct-probes`. There is no port
scanning or application crawling. Replace the placeholder to start:

```bash
recon "<domain-you-want-to-review>"
```

Ordinary lookups may reuse the 24-hour result cache. Use `--no-cache` to bypass
it; certificate-transparency enrichment has a separate cache. See
[first lookup and cache behavior](https://github.com/blisspixel/recon/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md#first-lookup).

## Common Commands

The bare command stays compact. Request evidence or structured output when needed:

```bash
recon example.com                      # compact panel
recon example.com --explain             # evidence and source status
recon example.com --json                # structured record
recon example.com --plain               # linear text for screen readers and grep
recon review example.com               # fresh, evidence-linked review bundle
recon batch domains.txt --json          # look up a supplied domain list
recon delta example.com                # compare with a cached baseline
recon update                           # update through the original package manager
```

These examples use reserved domains; real lookups will not reproduce the
synthetic illustration above. For multi-domain reviews, recon describes
observed similarities and differences without inferring ownership or a
corporate relationship. See the
[evidence-first review workflow](https://github.com/blisspixel/recon/blob/main/docs/defender-workflow.md)
and [batch guide](https://github.com/blisspixel/recon/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md#batch-and-delta).

## Use with an Agent

The PyPI package installs the CLI and MCP runtime. Connect the local server to
Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code, Windsurf, or Kiro:

```bash
recon mcp install --client=claude-desktop
recon mcp doctor
```

Restart the client and begin with manual tool approvals. Ask for one domain's
email and identity indicators, or a service comparison across supplied domains.
Missing evidence means "not observed", not "not used"; collection failures
remain explicit. Local execution is the default, and the project does not
operate a hosted service.

See [MCP setup and supported clients](https://github.com/blisspixel/recon/blob/main/docs/mcp.md)
and [skills, plugins, and their validation status](https://github.com/blisspixel/recon/blob/main/agents/README.md).

### Omarchy Desktop Shell Integration

recon includes a thin, keyboard-first desktop shell plugin for [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org)
located in [`integrations/omarchy/`](https://github.com/blisspixel/recon/blob/main/integrations/omarchy/):

- **Keyboard-driven workflow**: focus domain input automatically, press `Enter` to run
  bounded inspection, and press `Ctrl+D` to toggle baseline delta comparison.
- **Direct process invocation**: passes structured arguments directly (`["recon", domain, "--json"]`)
  without shell interpolation.
- **Safe clipboard handling**: pasting text never triggers an automatic network request.
- **Zero background daemons**: runs unprivileged inside Omarchy's Quickshell environment.

See [`integrations/omarchy/README.md`](https://github.com/blisspixel/recon/blob/main/integrations/omarchy/README.md) for installation and shortcuts.

## Contributing and Support

Catalog corrections and documented vendor patterns are especially useful.
Start with [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/blisspixel/recon/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for setup, verification, and contribution requirements; coding agents should
also read [AGENTS.md](https://github.com/blisspixel/recon/blob/main/AGENTS.md).

Use [issues](https://github.com/blisspixel/recon/issues) for bugs and feature
requests. Keep public examples reserved and synthetic; never post evaluated
company domains, tenant IDs, or per-domain results. See the
[private reporting paths](https://github.com/blisspixel/recon/blob/main/docs/data-handling-policy.md#private-non-security-reports)
and [security policy](https://github.com/blisspixel/recon/blob/main/SECURITY.md).
