    silently truncates on large targets — producing the enrichment
    asymmetry observed on bank-scale domains (one run returned 5 related

    ``after=`` cursor up to ``_MAX_PAGES`` pages, stopping early when
    enough subdomains have been collected or when the API returns an
    empty page.

    Rate limits: CertSpotter's free tier has weekly IP quotas. When the
    API returns a 429 or an empty first page, we stop and return what
    we have. The caller sees a smaller but non-zero result rather than
